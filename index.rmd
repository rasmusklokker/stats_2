This site primarily contains the lecture materials i used during tutorial/excercise
sessions in the course "Stats 2" at the Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen.

The slides provided here are in danish, however the source code in the main repository should be more accessible to "international audiences"

The structure of the site is heavily inspired by https://github.com/psu-psychology/psy-525-reproducible-research-2020/tree/master/how_to/web_site_template

and
