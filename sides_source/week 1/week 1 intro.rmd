## Multiple regression

Powerful!!

Now you can adjust for confounders that would otherwise bias your estimate!



      
```{r DAG_confound}

DiagrammeR::grViz("
      digraph mrdag {

      graph [rankdir=TB]

      node [shape=ellipse]
      U [label='Cultural capital of parents']

      node [shape=box, height=0.3, width=0.3]
      X [label='Education']
      Y [label='Salary']

      { rank = same; X Y }

      U -> X [color=red]
      U -> Y [color=red]
      X -> Y [minlen=3]
      }
      ", height = 200)

```
      
---

### in R

```{r confound_model}

cul.cap <- rnorm(1000)

education <- rnorm(1000)+3*cul.cap



salary <- 10*education+7.6*cul.cap+rnorm(1000)

df <- data.frame(salary=salary, education=education, cul_cap=cul.cap)



```



```{r regression_models, echo=TRUE}

lm.naive <- lm(salary~education, data=df)

lm.adjust <- lm(salary~education+cul_cap, data=df)



```

Because we cheated and made up some data, we know that the true effect of education on salary is 10. 

But if we estimate a naive association between salary and education the estimate of the effect is `r lm.naive$coefficients["education"]`.

if we adjust for cultural capital of parents, the estimated effect is `r lm.adjust$coefficients["education"]`



---

### Polynomial terms

Linear regression assumes that associations are linear, i.e. a straight line

but what if they are not linear?

What if the association actually looks like this?

```{r poly_model}

x <- rnorm(1000)

y <- 10*x+5*x^2+rnorm(1000)

df <- data.frame(y=y, x=x)


```


```{r poly_plot, out.width="400px"}

p <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x,y))
p <- p+geom_jitter()
p

```
---

Then we'd need a model with a polynomial term. In practial sense that means that we include $x^2$ in the model like this


### in R

```{r regression_models_poly, echo=TRUE}

lm.lin <- lm(y~x, data=df)

lm.poly <- lm(y~x+I(x^2), data=df)



```

```{r get fits}

fitted.lin <- fitted(lm.lin)

fitted.poly <- fitted(lm.poly)

df$fitted_lin <- fitted.lin 

df$fitted_poly <- fitted.poly 



```


---

The red line is the model with only $x$ and the green curve is from the model that also includes $x^2$. Including $x^2$ was clearly a good choice

```{r plot_fitted}

p <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x,y))
p <- p+geom_jitter()
p <- p+geom_point(data=df, aes(x,fitted_lin), color="red")
p <- p+geom_point(data=df, aes(x,fitted_poly), color="green")
p

```



---

### Interaction terms

What if the effect of something is not the same for everyone? What if getting a college degree is more impactful for people from a working class background than those from an affluent background?

```{r int_model}

education <- rnorm(1000)

class <- rbinom(1000, 1,.5)



salary <- 10*education+7.6*class+4.5*(class*education)+rnorm(1000)

df <- data.frame(salary=salary, education=education, class=class)

df$class <- ifelse(class==1, "working class", "affluent")


```

.pull-left[
```{r int_plot, out.width="400px"}

p <- ggplot(data=df, aes(education,salary, color=class))
p <- p+geom_jitter()
p

```
]


.pull-right[

### in R

```{r regression_models_int, echo=TRUE}


lm.int <- lm(salary~education+class+class*education, data=df)



```

]

---

## Causal inference

---

### Randomized controlled trials

The gold standard! 

Nearly a requirement in medical sciences, but not so much in social science. They are becoming more popular however

<!-- ![Number of RCTs in education research Connolly, Paul, Ciara Keenan, and Karolina Urbanska. "The trials of evidence-based practice in education: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials in education research 1980–2016." Educational Research 60.3 (2018): 276-291.](rct education.png) -->

```{r rcts_plot, out.width = "500px", fig.cap='Number of RCTs in education research Connolly, Paul, Ciara Keenan, and Karolina Urbanska. "The trials of evidence-based practice in education: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials in education research 1980–2016." Educational Research 60.3 (2018): 276-291.'}
knitr::include_graphics("rct_education.png")
```



Yields, on average, an unbiased estimate with minimal assumptions



---

### Instrumental variable(IV)

What if you can't do an RCT? 

For some reason, no one wants to fund a study in which we randomly select teenagers to pick up smoking.

Maybe there is a different way to go about it? 

```{r DAG_iv_smoke}

DiagrammeR::grViz("
      digraph mrdag {

      graph [rankdir=TB]

      node [shape=ellipse]
      U [label='Unobserved confounders']
      

      node [shape=box, height=0.3, width=0.3]
      X [label='Smoking']
      Y [label='Mortality']
      Z [label='tobacco law']

      { rank = same; X Y }

      U -> X [color=red]
      U -> Y [color=red]
      X -> Y [minlen=3]
      Z -> X
      }
      ", height = 200)

```
---
 
 
<!-- ![](ea iv.png) -->

```{r ea_iv, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("ea_iv.png")
```



```{r DAG_iv_ea}

DiagrammeR::grViz("
      digraph mrdag {

      graph [rankdir=TB]

      node [shape=ellipse]
      U [label='Unobserved confounders']
      

      node [shape=box, height=0.3, width=0.3]
      X [label='reading in spare time']
      Y [label='reading score']
      Z [label='sun is shining']

      { rank = same; X Y }

      U -> X [color=red]
      U -> Y [color=red]
      X -> Y [minlen=3]
      Z -> X
      }
      ", height = 200)

```

### Regression discontinuity 

Like IV, a method that utilizes "natural experiments".

This method relies on some kind of "cutoff" that determines who gets "treated" and who do not

The central idea is that, individuals close just above and just below the cutoff can function as treatment and control groups

e.g. GPA threshold for college admissions in DK
